# Snippetbox

This is my personal copy of [Alex Edwards'](https://github.com/alexedwards/) Snippetbox, a web-application written in Go that's built step-by-step in his book [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net).

There are some minor improvements I've added such as reading keys from a local.env file and using [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for live reloading.
